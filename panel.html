		<h3>The IEEE 2019 CyberSciTech/DASC/PICom/CBDCom Joint Panel on The Future Direction of Cybersecurity Research</h3>
		<p>
		Latest landscape of cyberattacks can be characterized with the diversification of attack methods using malwares such as targeted attacks, DoS attacks, Drive-by-Download, and with the variety of the attack targets such as governments, CII (automobiles, control systems etc.), companies, IoT devices. In addition, with the advent of new services/applications (e.g. IoT, Cloud, 5G) and technologies (e.g. Fintech, BlockChain), the attackers are able to expand the attack targets and upgrade/improve the attack methods.<br/>
		In order to protect our valuable assets and systems from cyber threats and attacks, with comprehensive consideration through academia, governments, important infrastructures, enterprises and individuals, innovative and challenging cybersecurity measures are expected to be urgently and effectively researched and developed. In such a diverse and rapidly changing environment including increase of attack surfaces, this panel aims at providing an academic roundtable among world-class experts for scholars to brain storming, exchange new ideas and innovative technologies, and even undertake joint research studies about cybersecurity research. The topics include but not limited to:<br/>
		1）Observation of Cyber Threats and Attacks – Events Collections<br/>
		2）Emerging, Promising and Challenging Cybersecurity Technologies<br/>
		3）Observation of Cyber Threats and Attacks<br/>
		4）Big data Analysis for Cybersecurity<br/>
		5）How to share and distribute for Cybersecurity<br/>
		6）How to collaborate and jointly study on Cybersecurity<br/>
		7）How to settle and establish Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy for Research<br/>
