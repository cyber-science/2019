                <b>Abstract</b>: Service-oriented computing has profoundly affected the personal computing experience. Users no longer run every application and store their data on a single computer. Instead they own and operate a complex multi-device ensemble made of desktop computers, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, glasses, cars, or any sort of internet-connected thing to manage their personal information and accomplish their tasks by accessing software delivered as a service. Many approaches to achieve a liquid user experience whereby data and software can seamlessly flow and adapt across smart devices are starting to appear within proprietary platforms relying on centralized solutions, where data is conveniently stored in the Cloud, outside the control of the users producing and consuming it. In this talk we discuss how the open Web currently undergoing a re-decentralization might still play an important role within a programmable smart world.<br/><br/>
                <b>Biography</b>: Cesare Pautasso is full professor at the Software Institute of the Faculty of Informatics at the University of Lugano, Switzerland. Previously he was a researcher at the IBM Zurich Research Lab and a senior researcher at ETH Zurich. He completed his graduate studies with a Ph.D. from ETH Zurich in 2004. His research group focuses on building experimental systems to explore the intersection of Software Architecture, Web Engineering and Business Process Management with research projects on liquid software, RESTful conversation mining, microservice performance benchmarking, and interactive Web presentations. He was the general chair of the ICWE 2016 and ECOWS 2011, program co-chair of ICSOC 2013, ECOWS 2010 and Software Composition 2008. He has also started the series of International Workshops on RESTful Design (WS-REST) at the WWW conference. He is co-editor of the IEEE Software Insights department. He has co-authored a book on SOA with REST: Principles, Patterns & Constraints for Building Enterprise Solutions with REST in 2012 and is currently finishing another titled "Just Send An Email: Anti-Patterns for email-centric organizations" available on Leanpub.
