                <b>Abstract</b>: The growing presence of high-performance cameras and microphones throughout the everyday environment has enabled the remote acquisition of biometric identity information such as the face, voice, and gait and even fingerprints, veins, and iris that can be easily shared in cyberspace. This capability poses a threat in that it provides other means of “spoofing” biometric authentication systems in order to commit fraud. Measures must thus be taken to protect such systems against the misuse of biometric information. On the other hand, since biometric authentication has become widely used as a means of personal authentication, the provision of such biometric information at the time of authentication must be made as convenient as possible. This talk introduces the challenges faced regarding security and privacy against the acquisition of a person’s biometric identity information and the distribution of that information in cyberspace on the basis of that person’s wishes while maintaining the practical convenience of biometric authentication. It also describes fruitful demonstration testing using a prototype aimed at meeting these challenges.<br/><br/>
