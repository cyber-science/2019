                <b>Abstract</b>: The growing presence of high-performance cameras and microphones throughout the everyday environment has enabled the remote acquisition of biometric identity information such as the face, voice, and gait and even fingerprints, veins, and iris that can be easily shared in cyberspace. This capability poses a threat in that it provides other means of “spoofing” biometric authentication systems in order to commit fraud. Measures must thus be taken to protect such systems against the misuse of biometric information. On the other hand, since biometric authentication has become widely used as a means of personal authentication, the provision of such biometric information at the time of authentication must be made as convenient as possible. This talk introduces the challenges faced regarding security and privacy against the acquisition of a person’s biometric identity information and the distribution of that information in cyberspace on the basis of that person’s wishes while maintaining the practical convenience of biometric authentication. It also describes fruitful demonstration testing using a prototype aimed at meeting these challenges.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Service-oriented computing has profoundly affected the personal computing experience. Users no longer run every application and store their data on a single computer. Instead they own and operate a complex multi-device ensemble made of desktop computers, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, glasses, cars, or any sort of internet-connected thing to manage their personal information and accomplish their tasks by accessing software delivered as a service. Many approaches to achieve a liquid user experience whereby data and software can seamlessly flow and adapt across smart devices are starting to appear within proprietary platforms relying on centralized solutions, where data is conveniently stored in the Cloud, outside the control of the users producing and consuming it. In this talk we discuss how the open Web currently undergoing a re-decentralization might still play an important role within a programmable smart world.<br/><br/>
                <b>Biography</b>: Cesare Pautasso is full professor at the Software Institute of the Faculty of Informatics at the University of Lugano, Switzerland. Previously he was a researcher at the IBM Zurich Research Lab and a senior researcher at ETH Zurich. He completed his graduate studies with a Ph.D. from ETH Zurich in 2004. His research group focuses on building experimental systems to explore the intersection of Software Architecture, Web Engineering and Business Process Management with research projects on liquid software, RESTful conversation mining, microservice performance benchmarking, and interactive Web presentations. He was the general chair of the ICWE 2016 and ECOWS 2011, program co-chair of ICSOC 2013, ECOWS 2010 and Software Composition 2008. He has also started the series of International Workshops on RESTful Design (WS-REST) at the WWW conference. He is co-editor of the IEEE Software Insights department. He has co-authored a book on SOA with REST: Principles, Patterns & Constraints for Building Enterprise Solutions with REST in 2012 and is currently finishing another titled "Just Send An Email: Anti-Patterns for email-centric organizations" available on Leanpub.

                Liming (Luke) CHEN, <i>Professor, De Montfort University, UK</i> <br/><br/>
                <b>Abstract</b>: We are living in an increasingly smarter world where we do business, communicate and recreate among and across physical, cyber, social and mental spaces. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) offers mechanisms, technologies and tools which integrate and interweave physical entities, e.g. the internet of things, smart objects and devices and embedded systems, cyber entities, e.g. apps, social software and algorithms, and mental machinery, to support and facilitate cross-space multi-modal interactions and functionalities. The challenge is how smart CPSs should or can be in order to meet varying needs of different cohorts of users, and one of the core enabling technologies is computational behaviour analysis which can discover individual users’ ways of performing tasks, thus supporting advanced features, such as adaptation, personalisation and decision-making recommendation. In this talk the speaker will characterise the smart world concepts, and examine closely the research issues, methodologies and approaches to computational behaviour analysis which underpin the new wave smart cyber-physical systems. After this he will present his recent research and initial results in e-learning, healthcare and social network analysis describing the latest behaviour modelling and analysis technologies. He will then discuss research challenges and future directions which are aimed at stimulating and enlightening new ideas and approaches in this emerging research area.<br/><br/>
